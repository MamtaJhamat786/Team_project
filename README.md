# Project description
This application is for those who would like to find their hobby partners in sports field. Though this application people will be able to register theirselves using email and password and by telling their hobbies. Once they are logged in they will be able to join teams of different fields and they can see team members and can contact them. This application will help the people to make new teams and collaborate with each other, share new experience and spend their time. There is need of this application because there are so many international people in every country and they do not know where they can go to play and how they can find people with same hobbies with whom they can play so this is very nice platform for them.
 
# Tech stack
Framework- Vuejs, 
Library - bootstrap vue,
backend- Firebase,
Language- javascript

# Main milestones  that help you stay on track
As a way to completion, we have divided the functions of the application into three main parts. 1st of all, the design must be decided and created, 2nd part is to routing which is connecting each page, 3rd is the last to implement each function.

1st milestone: Define and create the design of each page, and implement login-in & sign-up function
2nd milestone: Set the routing and connect each page correctly, this would be CRUD application, therefore, must create 4 pages here.
3rd milestone: Database connecting and listing view. Finally, the user can see page moving, furthermore, he/she can see the list from the database(firebase).
